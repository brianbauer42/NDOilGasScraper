INITIAL SETUP (This only has to be done once).
1. Make sure you have python3
        https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. open PowerShell, navigate to this directory, and type `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`



CONVENIENCE
To save your login info so you aren't prompted on each run, you can create a file in this directory called:
"credentials.py" in this directory. This file should contain the following 2 lines (the single quotes are required):
username = 'ExampleName'
password = 'ExamplePass'



USAGE
At a PowerShell terminal, navigate to this folder.
Type 'python3 scrape.py' and follow the prompts.
On my quad core macbook pro, getting that 15 years of data (starting 2005) took about 5 minutes.



NOTE ABOUT WINDOWS
I haven't tested it yet!



NOTE ABOUT MACOS >= HIGH SIERRA
multiprocessing will cause errors, fix by adding an env variable with this command:
`export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES`
