INITIAL SETUP (This only has to be done once).
1. Make sure you have python3
        https://www.python.org/downloads/
2  You will need to have Chrome installed on your computer.
        https://www.google.com/chrome/
3. You will also need to download the 'chrome driver' and put it in this directory.
        https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
4. open PowerShell, navigate to this directory, and type `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

USAGE
At a PowerShell terminal, navigate to this folder.
Type 'python3 scrape.py' and follow the prompts.
Running time could be more than 30 minutes if going back further to 2005.
On my quad core macbook pro, getting that 15 years of data should take about 10 minutes.

NOTE ABOUT MACOS >= HIGH SIERRA
multiprocessing will cause errors, fix by adding an env variable with this command:
`export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES`
